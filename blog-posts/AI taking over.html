            The subject is fascinating, as so many organizations are betting their fortunes that the machines will not be taking over their jobs. Nobody knows when the robots will take over or how many jobs they'll take. Trash pickers, bus drivers, and interstate truckers will be the first people. Who will lose their livelihoods as trash pickers to artificial intelligence?

            Human resources managers, writers, lawyers, psychiatrists, and event planners are among those jobs A.I. is not likely to take over soon.

            People who know about the inner workings of an artificial intelligence bot will always find jobs. In the future, the roles of jobs will not just be limited by one skill: that is something machines are good at. Human jobs will be about managing and fixing. Those AI tools, in order to improve performance even more. Many of those working on those jobs may look to AI to help them reason out problems, but in the end, humans will decide.

            AI will have to learn about the complexity of humans, and will have to decide after thinking about their actions in order to take over the creative role. For AI to replace creativity, it would need to understand human complexity and decide after reflecting. AI is a tool that could be used in various occupations for better work. They found AI with the idea that human intelligence could be described in such a way as to simplify it for computers to copy and perform tasks of any difficulty.
    
            AI is artificial general intelligence—the stuff humans are like. Basically, what a few brilliant people are trying to get at is a computer system that imitates the intelligence of human beings. Humans are trying to get a system that emulates our intelligence. AI is the tool created to help us on the path towards intelligence.

            Humans are today surrounded by examples of Artificial Intelligence, and in this way, it has infiltrated our daily lives. Simplistically, machines are learning, automatically, from existing data, with no help from humans. Machines, driven by their own needs, become creative in their own ways.

            To wring satisfying images from DALL-E 2 requires creativity, as well as knowing how to describe these ideas in a runnable manner. In this respect, DALL-E 2 is not that different from a human beings’ creative abilities: The key to getting a satisfying picture out of either is knowing how best to ask.
    
            Simply enter a series of commands in DALL-E, and it generates a picture that illustrates them almost instantly. When the user asks DALL-E 2 to create an image that does not yet exist, such as Giraffe doing Yoga, it can take what it knows about Giraffe and yoga and generate the image.
    
            DALL-E 2 is trained with 3.5 billion parameters from captioned images, and responds to natural-language queries like you are talking to a person, rather than a computer. DALL-E 2 creativity is limited only by the imaginations of the users behind it, so I am not losing any sleep about my artificial intelligence replacement — not yet. The research laboratory OpenAI, in San Francisco, sees DALL-E as a sketching tool that enhances and expands human creativity, rather than replacing it.

            AI tools such as DALL-E 2 are even making full human substitution possible in certain imaginable creative fields, such as full machine-control over textual or visual tasks. Ultimately, while machine learning and AI may very well replace designers, if we do a good job with deployment and careful planning, computers may complement humans instead, providing greater creativity, greater expression, and greater flow. Where the prior revolution led to more specialized, repetitive work, the AI revolution would enable us to put our attention back on our human strengths, such as creativity and strategic thinking, to complete more fulfilling tasks. Companies that harness the creative processes that AI augments will be the winners of the day.

            I believe AI has the potential to improve creativity processes. I think AIs have the potential to create creativity and design innovative new formats. While it may be true that creative AI is lacking consistency, I do not doubt we will see new systems incorporate consistency in their models. If discovering answers requires seeing the world differently, AI is not only creative, it is also likely to possess high levels of creativity and intelligence. We design AI to serve as an aid, helping humans to keep up our creative level of genius.

            Now, AI could be used by humans as a tool to provide them with predictions and suggestions about what they should be doing. AI is just another tool. Artists would use this to make new media. Any job involving creativity or solving creative problems—musicians, artists, writers, marketers, inventors, will not be replaced by artificial intelligence. Yes, AI will replace some jobs, but others are here to stay, or they will be created new thanks to artificial intelligence. Millions of existing jobs are likely to be eliminated by artificial intelligence, while millions of new ones, some not even imagined yet, will come about. Automation will replace some roles, but this is only to make room for the new jobs of a future economy. Automation will empower human customer support representatives, but they will not depend on it, because humans will still dominate over 80 percent of multifunctional decision tasks. These fields will experience job growth not despite, but because of, AI. As a result, productivity is suffering, and turnover is likely to increase at organizations that refuse to embrace automation in order to reduce drudgery and increase creativity.

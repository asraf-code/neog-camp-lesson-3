            People are using AR to make life easier, and a lot of forward-thinking companies are working on AR to enhance workflows and businesses. Here, Augmented Reality is a better technology, and there are gaming companies using AR technologies to provide better experiences for users.

            With Augmented Reality (AR), gaming terrains are being improved within the virtual environments to allow users to do the activities of real-world. AR became popular in the 2010s, with devices such as Google Glass, Microsoft HoloLens, and even smartphones with sensors that can track the users’ location and orientation, allowing them to see digital content layered over the top of their real-world surroundings. 

            AR technology could also create more immersive experiences at events such as concerts, sporting events, and even theme parks, giving attendees the opportunity to view interactive digital content that augments their surroundings.

            The biggest benefit of Augmented Reality (AR) is that it is currently being used in many fields such as games, marketing, education, and health care, with many applications in education, training, navigation, design, and entertainment (Snapchat, Google Lens, Ikea Place, etc). 

            AR’s famous cousin is mainly used for entertainment applications, can also copy the physical environment for learning or, in case of unavailable equipment needed for training, VR can put technicians into the virtual environment using equipment holograms. Augmented Reality is being used for testing new doctors, as well as explaining medical techniques to medical students. With its use, students can study medical techniques without having to use dead bodies.

            Augmented reality applications, running on hand-held devices used as VR headsets, may also digitize human beings in space, and offer computer-generated models of them, within the virtual space, in which they can interact and do different actions.

            In mixed reality, one interacts and manipulates with and between both physical and virtual objects and environments, using current-generation sensory and imaging technologies. Mixed reality lets you see and experience the world around you, while also using your hands to interact with a virtual environment - all without ever taking off the headset. This app is being used anywhere from healthcare technology industries to retail to even manufacturing. The search engine company is reintroducing Google Glass as an augmented reality tool for the workforce.

            Ikea experimented with AR way back in 2012, when shoppers could use an app to see what tables and shelves looked like in different places in their home. Harley Davidson, a globally known motorcycling brand, is a prime example of a brand well using it, developing an AR app for shoppers to use in-store. AR is also going to transform how companies service customers, train employees, design and manufacture products, manage their value chains, and eventually, how they compete.
